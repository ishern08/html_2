        <p>
            This is my best friend. Her name is Mak. I've known her since middle school,
            but we got closer in high school. We play softball together.
        </p>
        <p>
            I also have other friends at school.
            <em>My favorite thing to do with them is go out to eat!</em>
            I also enjoy playing board games with them.

        <h2>Family</h2>
        <p>
            This is my family. I have a mom, dad, and sister.
            My sister is eight years older than me, and she lives in Brooklyn, New York.
        </p>
        <p>
            My favorite thing to do with my family is watch movies and go shopping!
            I also enjoy Christmas because my whole family gets together to celebrate.
